		<p>Snake snaks are yum. They should be eaten. Snake snaks are very bad for you though. Even though they look good they are very bad for your health. You can try not to eat them if they are right in front of you but you will because they look DECIEVING. THEY WILL KILL YOU IF YOU EAT TOO MUCH! ARGH!</p>
